    <p>West Point Middle School is seeking members for a newly formed <a href="https://www.mathcounts.org/programs/national-math-club">National Math Club</a> and <a href="https://www.mathcounts.org/programs/mathcounts-competition-series">MATHCOUNTS Competition Team</a>.

		This is for children who enjoy math and desire more opportunities to:
		<ol>
			<li>have fun doing mathematics, </li>
			<li>explore more math topics than typically taught in school, </li>
			<li>attempt very challenging problems, and </li>
			<li>meet other students with similar interests. </li>
		</ol>
		
		We will meet Tuesdays and Thursdays, 2:30-3:00PM, in room 126, on school days without an early release. No transportation provided; parents of bus riders will need to pick up their children.
		
		Please RSVP at least 24hrs prior so that I can print enough materials for everyone.
