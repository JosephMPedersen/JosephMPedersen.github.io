    <p>West Point Middle School is seeking members for a newly formed <a href="https://www.mathcounts.org/programs/national-math-club" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Math Club</a> and <a href="https://www.mathcounts.org/programs/mathcounts-competition-series" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MATHCOUNTS Competition Team</a>.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>have fun doing mathematics, </li>
			<li>explore more math topics than typically taught in school, </li>
			<li>attempt very challenging problems, and </li>
			<li>meet other students with similar interests. </li>

	<p>
		We will meet Tuesdays and Thursdays, 2:30-3:00PM, in room 126, on school days without an early release. <br><br>
